I set up this blog to document processes I've completed or processes otherwise
not well documented so that I can repeat them and easily share with others. If
anyone else can benefit from the content I've created here, awesome!

This site has nothing to do with tacos, sorry! I bought the domain `taco.moe`
because it's 8 characters long and easy to remember. (Plus who doesn't love
tacos!) I needed a domain to set up a home lab to prototype solutions. Setting
up enterprise software is easier with valid TLS certificates and a valid TLD,
so `taco.moe` was born.
